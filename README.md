# developer-desktops

This project is intended to act as a repository of tooling for building "developer" desktops for developers and other users that require a consistent set of tooling be pre-installed to Windows- or Linux-based environments:

* Windows automation will be delivered in the form of Powershell scripts
* Linux automation will be delivered in the form of BASH scripts

Further, this project will contain Dockerfiles suitable to help in the linting of the above automation-types
